# atlas-printf
This is a group project between Danny McGeough and Bret Johnson.
We are attempting to create our own printf function with something
approaching the same functionality and usability of the standard
print function. We will not be handling all format specified types
and will follow the instructions to create a working project
of smaller scope. 
More sections will be added to this README upon completion.
