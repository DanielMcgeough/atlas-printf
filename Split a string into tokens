char str[] = "strtok needs to be called several times to split a string";
The words are separated by space. So space will be our delimiter.
  char delim[] = " ";
strtok accepts two strings - the first one is the the character of next token. 
  char *ptr = strtok(str, delim);
strtok needs to be called several times to split a string
^
ptr points here
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
	char str[] = "strtok needs to be called several times to split a string";
	int init_size = strlen(str);
	char delim[] = "ai";

	char *ptr = strtok(str, delim);

	while (ptr != NULL)
	{
		printf("'%s'\n", ptr);
		ptr = strtok(NULL, delim);
